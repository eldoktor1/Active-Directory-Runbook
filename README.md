## ðŸ§© Full Setup Process

### Step 1: Join the Computer to the Domain
Log in using the local administrator account (`administrator` / `Pa$$w0rd`).

Open Control Panel > System and Security > System.  
![Step](Active-Directory-Runbook-Images/image1.png)

Click "Change settings" to open System Properties.

In the Computer Name tab, click "Change..."  
![Step](Active-Directory-Runbook-Images/image3.png)

Select "Domain" and enter `contoso.com`.  
![Step](Active-Directory-Runbook-Images/image4.png)

Enter domain credentials when prompted.  
![Step](Active-Directory-Runbook-Images/image5.png)

Once successfully joined, you will be prompted to restart the system to apply changes. Restart the computer to complete the process.

### Step 2: Create a New User in Active Directory
Log in to the domain controller or a computer with administrative tools.

Open the **Active Directory Users and Computers** console.  
![Search and Launch ADUC](Active-Directory-Runbook-Images/image6.png)

Expand your domain (e.g., `contoso.com`) and navigate to the **Users** container.  
![Select Domain in ADUC](Active-Directory-Runbook-Images/image7.png)

Right-click the **Users** container and choose **New > User**.
